# Census API Python Script

This script creates a pandas dataframe and csv file from the U.S. Census Decennial Census API, which offers access to population data by sex, age, race, etc. and housing data by occupancy, vacancy status, and tenure. 

In three short steps, you'll be querying to your heart's content.


## 1) Request a Census API Key

* 3142 counties in U.S. States and Territories
* 685 metropolitan areas (50,000 + population) in the U.S.
